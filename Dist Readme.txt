Dragon Tools is a collection of tools for interfacing with the Dragon family
of 1980's home computers in a Windows environment.  There are several excellent
Dragon emulators.  These tools attempt to bridge the gap between these
emulators and the host Windows environment.

The Microsoft Windows .NET 4 framework must be installed to use these tools.
The .NET framework can be downloaded through Windows Update or from the
www.microsoft.com site.

The following tools are currently included:

DragonDos
	Permits accessing DragonDos filesystem in virtual diskette images.  The
	VDK, DSK and HFE virtual diskette formats are currently supported.

Refer to the wiki at https://github.com/rolfmichelsen/dragontools/wiki for
full documentation of the tools.  This site also hosts the source code for
the tools.
